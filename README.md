  _\* if you can't find your login info, search your inbox for an e-mail from "Snowflake Computing"._
  
4. Use the information in the connect dialog to fill in your `secrets.toml` file:

  ```
[snowflake]
account = "[Account Identifier]"
user = "[User Name]"
password = "[Same as when you signed up. Be careful here and don't check this in to GitHub!"
role = "[Role]"
host = "[Account/Server URL]"
```

5. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to make sure you have all the dependencies working.

6. Run `streamlit run streamlit.app` and you should see a simple chat app ready to chat with you! Try changing the model used: `mistral-large2`, `claude-3-5-sonnet` or `llama3.1-70b` and compare the chat interaction!
